    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p> To explain a reflection property of a parabola I will consider the parabola
        This is a general case and I will use it to make the explanations easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's take function f(x) = ax<sup>2</sup>.
        Imagine a parallel ray reflecting in the parabola. Let's name the intersection point as P=(x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub>).
        <br>Let's construct a line tangent to the parabola in point P. It has a formula of:
        y: a<sub>t</sub>x + b<sub>t</sub>
        <br>a<sub>t</sub> is equal to the value of f'(x<sub>0</sub>)
        <br> f'(x<sub>0</sub>) = 2 * a * x<sub>0</sub>

        As we know from physics lesson The law of reflection states that angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
        Let's look at this general case drawing. <br>
        <img style="width: 300px" src="assignment2_2_pic.png">
        <br>Let's find a formula for the reflection line (the one going through G and B).
        <br>y<sub>f</sub> = a<sub>f</sub>x + b<sub>f</sub>
        <br>y<sub>f</sub> = tg(β)x  + b<sub>f</sub> .
        <br> Firstly notice that: γ + γ + 90° - β = 180°
        <br> That is: β = 2γ - 90°
        <br> Also: γ = α because γ + 90° == α + 90°
        <br> tg(β) = tg(2γ - 90°) = (some calculations) = - 1 / tg(2α)
        <br><img style="max-width: 150px" src="tg2alfa.png">
        <br> tg(β) = tg<sup>2</sup>(α) - 1 / (2 * tg(α))
        <br> tg(α) is easy to compute. It equals to f'(x<sub>0</sub>) = 2ax<sub>0</sub>
        <br>
        <br> tg(β) = (4a<sup>2</sup>x<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1) / (4ax<sub>0</sub>)
        <br><br>
        For the computation of y<sub>f</sub> we still lack b<sub>f</sub>. <br>
        we know that the B point lays on the intersection of parabola and the y<sub>b</sub><br>

        (4a<sup>2</sup>x<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1) / (4ax<sub>0</sub>) * x<sub>0</sub>  + b<sub>f</sub> = a x<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>
        <br>
        (some calculations)<br>
        b<sub>f</sub> =  - 1 / (4a)<br>

        y(0) = a<sub>f</sub> * 0 + b<sub>f</sub> = b<sub>f</sub> = -0.25a
        <br><br> It is clearly visible that no matter what value of x<sub>0</sub> we choose
        (in other words: no matter where the ray is gonna "hit" the parabola) the reflection line will <b>always</b>
        go through point (0, -0.25/a).
        This proves the focal property of parabola
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I have explained how it works only in a general case, one can imagine easily that
        we can obtain any parabola by translating this function by a vector (as we know we can write a formula for any
        parabola by translating a function f(x) = ax<sup>2</sup> within a vector (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>).
        Thus, it means that the focal property stays the same, just the focus point will be moved by this vector as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example the parabole equation is y = x<sup>2</sup>/200. <br>
        "a" coeffficient equals to 1/200, so the focus point is:<br>
        [0, -1/(4 * 1/200)] = [0, 50]
